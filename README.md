HW 1

 

- Implement a Hierarchical location scheme and show a demo with the following as components.


- Simulate the scheme based on the number of calls made and the mobility of users under a Hierarchical location scheme. Then show how using forwarding pointers (tree level based) at different levels can reduce the latency in making the number of calls made and how many nodes tat that level can benefit. Also, show how when you reduce say the number of nodes or calls, the level should change in the tree.

- Show replication in a hierarchical scheme, where location info should be replicated based on the number of calls verses the node movements. Simulate to compare update verses search cost in the above scheme.
 

Show using some type of user interface with a dynamic tree consisting of nodes, and should trace the calls from caller to calle. The tree generation should be dynamic.
